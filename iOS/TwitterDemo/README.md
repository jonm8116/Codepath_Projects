# Project 4 - *Twitter Demo App*

**Twitter Demo** is a basic twitter app to read and compose tweets the [Twitter API](https://apps.twitter.com/).

Time spent: **14** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can sign in using OAuth login flow

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to increment retweets and favorites on the server side of things
2. How to format and display the design in a much better format and how load in higher resolution images.

## Notes

This was a very challenging app to build and it was the most challenging app we have built thus far. There was quite a few steps that I had worked which were not as clear to me and I found some areas in which I was unsure of what to do. I also needed alot more help to work on this app.

## Notes

This app along with the last app were quite tough to build. I was unsure of how to start this app and was unsure on how to implement certain features on this app. I kept running into nil values when I tried to show the tweets detail page which would display the tweet and I was not able to find the reason why the value was nil.
