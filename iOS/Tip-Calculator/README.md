Issues I ran into:

As I was working on this app I ran into a few issues:
- I first had an issue in getting my Bill Field to display data (this issue was corrected thanks to help I received from the code path team)
- I also wasn't able to make my initial view controller segue to my settings page. I used a push segue however it didn't transition from one view controller to the next. I wasn't able to figure out how to get around this issue.
