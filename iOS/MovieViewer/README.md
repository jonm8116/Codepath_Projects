# Project 1 - MovieViewer

MovieViewer is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: 6 hours hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [x] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can search for a movie.
- [ ] All images fade in as they are loading.

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Initially I had trouble with trying to create a search bar but I was later able to implement a search bar in the Yelp app with help from others. I will try to come back and implement the search bar in this app when I have more time.
2. I had initial trouble trying to implement the MBProgressHUD because I wasn't sure of where to insert the code in the viewDidLoad method
